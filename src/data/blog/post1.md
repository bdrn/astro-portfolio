# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

First **Astro blog post!**  
This is a test to make sure Markdown rendering and routing are working correctly.

> Astro makes building content-driven sites feel light and fast â€” no heavy JavaScript, just HTML, Markdown, and a sprinkle of interactivity when you need it.

Code block example:

```js
console.log("Astro is fast ðŸš€");
```
