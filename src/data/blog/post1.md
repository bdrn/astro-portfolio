## Post (1)

The main purpose of this site is to showcase my projects and ideas, but more than that, it's a place for me to **write, reflect, and document the process** of building and experimenting. I've always found it rewarding to look back at past work and see how much progress was made, even if it didn't feel like it in the moment. Writing these posts will give me a way to capture not only the _finished_ projects, but also the **process, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.** This blog isn't meant to be polished documentation, think of it more like a public journal.
